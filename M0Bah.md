*An Introduction to Device Drivers*
[remote](https://static.lwn.net/images/pdf/LDD3/ch01.pdf)
---

One of the many advantages of free operating systems, as typified by Linux, is that their internals are open for all to view.
The operating system, once a dark and mysterious area whose code was restricted to a small number of programmers, can now be readily examined, understood, and modified by anybody with the requisite skills.
Linux has helped to democratize operating systems. The Linux kernel remains a
large and complex body of code, however, and would-be kernel hackers need an
entry point where they can approach the code without being overwhelmed by complexity. Often, device drivers provide that gateway.
Device drivers take on a special role in the Linux kernel. They are distinct “black
boxes” that make a particular piece of hardware respond to a well-defined internal
programming interface; they hide completely the details of how the device works.
User activities are performed by means of a set of standardized calls that are independent of the specific driver; mapping those calls to device-specific operations that act
on real hardware is then the role of the device driver. This programming interface is
such that drivers can be built separately from the rest of the kernel and “plugged in”
at runtime when needed. This modularity makes Linux drivers easy to write, to the
point that there are now hundreds of them available.
There are a number of reasons to be interested in the writing of Linux device drivers.
The rate at which new hardware becomes available (and obsolete!) alone guarantees
that driver writers will be busy for the foreseeable future. Individuals may need to
know about drivers in order to gain access to a particular device that is of interest to
them. Hardware vendors, by making a Linux driver available for their products, can
add the large and growing Linux user base to their potential markets. And the open
source nature of the Linux system means that if the driver writer wishes, the source
to a driver can be quickly disseminated to millions of users.
This book teaches you how to write your own drivers and how to hack around in
related parts of the kernel. We have taken a device-independent approach; the programming techniques and interfaces are presented, whenever possible, without being
tied to any specific device. Each driver is different; as a driver writer, you need to

understand your specific device well. But most of the principles and basic techniques are the same for all drivers. This book cannot teach you about your device,
but it gives you a handle on the background you need to make your device work.
As you learn to write drivers, you find out a lot about the Linux kernel in general;
this may help you understand how your machine works and why things aren’t
always as fast as you expect or don’t do quite what you want. We introduce new
ideas gradually, starting off with very simple drivers and building on them; every new
concept is accompanied by sample code that doesn’t need special hardware to be
tested.
This chapter doesn’t actually get into writing code. However, we introduce some
background concepts about the Linux kernel that you’ll be glad you know later,
when we do launch into programming.

What is the role of a device driver?

As a  programmer, you are able  to make your own  choices about your driver, and
choose  an acceptable trade-off  between the programming  time required  and the
flexibility of the result. Though it may appear strange  to say that a driver is
"flexible", we like this word  because it emphasizes  that the role  of a device
driver is providing mechanism, not policy.

How to measure flexibility of the device driver?
What are mechanism and policies?

The distinction between mechanism and policy is one of the best ideas behind the
Unix design. Most programming problems can indeed be split into two parts: "what
capabilities are to be provided" (the mechanism) and "how those capabilities can
be used" (the policy). If the two issues are addressed by different parts of the
program, or even by different programs  altogether, the software package is much
easier to develop and to adapt to particular needs.

For example, Unix  management of  the graphic  display is  split  between  the X
server, which knows the hardware and offers a unified interface to user programs,
and the window and session managers, which implement a particular policy without
knowing anything  about the hardware. People can  use the same window manager on
different hardware, and different  users can run different configurations on the
same workstation.  Even completely different  desktop environments, such  as KDE
and  GNOME, can  coexist on  the same  system. Another  example is  the  layered
structure  of  TCP/IP  networking:   the  operating  system  offers  the  socket
abstraction, which  implements no policy  regarding the  data to  be transferred,
while  different  servers  are  in  charge of the services (and their associated
policies).  Moreover, a server  like ftpd provides  the file transfer  mechanism,
while  users can  use whatever client they prefer; both command-line and graphic
clients exist, and anyone can write a new user interface to transfer files.

Что касается драйверов,
Where drivers are concerned, the same separation of mechanism and policy applies.
The floppy driver  is policy free -- its role  is only to show the diskette as a
continuous  array of data blocks. Higher levels  of the system  provide policies,
such as who may access  the floppy drive, whether the drive is accessed directly
or via a filesystem, and whether users may mount filesystems on the drive. Since
different  environments  usually  need to use  hardware in  different ways, it’s
important to be as policy free as possible.

When writing drivers, a programmer should pay particular attention to this fundamental concept: write kernel code to access the hardware, but don’t force particular
policies on the user, since different users have different needs. The driver should deal
with making the hardware available, leaving all the issues about how to use the hardware to the applications. A driver, then, is flexible if it offers access to the hardware
capabilities without adding constraints. Sometimes, however, some policy decisions
must be made. For example, a digital I/O driver may only offer byte-wide access to
the hardware in order to avoid the extra code needed to handle individual bits.
You can also look at your driver from a different perspective: it is a software layer
that lies between the applications and the actual device. This privileged role of the
driver allows the driver programmer to choose exactly how the device should appear:
different drivers can offer different capabilities, even for the same device. The actual
driver design should be a balance between many different considerations. For
instance, a single device may be used concurrently by different programs, and the
driver programmer has complete freedom to determine how to handle concurrency.
You could implement memory mapping on the device independently of its hardware
capabilities, or you could provide a user library to help application programmers
implement new policies on top of the available primitives, and so forth. One major
consideration is the trade-off between the desire to present the user with as many
options as possible and the time you have to write the driver, as well as the need to
keep things simple so that errors don’t creep in.

Policy-free drivers have a number of typical characteristics. These include support for
both synchronous and asynchronous operation, the ability to be opened multiple
times, the ability to exploit the full capabilities of the hardware, and the lack of software layers to “simplify things” or provide policy-related operations. Drivers of this
sort not only work better for their end users, but also turn out to be easier to write
and maintain as well. Being policy-free is actually a common target for software
designers.

Many device drivers, indeed, are released together with user programs to help with
configuration and access to the target device. Those programs can range from simple
utilities to complete graphical applications. Examples include the tunelp program,
which adjusts how the parallel port printer driver operates, and the graphical cardctl
utility that is part of the PCMCIA driver package. Often a client library is provided as
well, which provides capabilities that do not need to be implemented as part of the
driver itself.

The scope of this book is the kernel, so we try not to deal with policy issues or with
application programs or support libraries. Sometimes we talk about different policies and how to support them, but we won’t go into much detail about programs
using the device or the policies they enforce. You should understand, however, that
user programs are an integral part of a software package and that even policy-free
packages are distributed with configuration files that apply a default behavior to the
underlying mechanisms.

@sct Splitting the Kernel

In a Unix system, several concurrent processes attend to different tasks. Each process
asks for system resources, be it computing power, memory, network connectivity, or
some other resource. The kernel is the big chunk of executable code in charge of handling all such requests. Although the distinction between the different kernel tasks
isn’t always clearly marked, the kernel’s role can be split (as shown in Figure 1-1)
into the following parts:
Process management
The kernel is in charge of creating and destroying processes and handling their
connection to the outside world (input and output). Communication among different processes (through signals, pipes, or interprocess communication primitives) is basic to the overall system functionality and is also handled by the
kernel. In addition, the scheduler, which controls how processes share the CPU,
is part of process management. More generally, the kernel’s process management activity implements the abstraction of several processes on top of a single
CPU or a few of them.

@tags Memory management

1: How are policy used to deal with memory and system performance related?

The computer’s memory  is a major resource, and the policy  used to deal with it
is a critical  one  for  system  performance. The  kernel  builds  up a  virtual
addressing  space  for any  and all  processes on  top of the  limited available
resources. The different parts of the kernel interact with the memory-management
subsystem  through a set of function calls, ranging  from the simple malloc/free
pair to much more complex functionalities.

Filesystems
Unix is heavily based on the filesystem concept; almost everything in Unix can
be treated as a file. The kernel builds a structured filesystem on top of unstructured hardware, and the resulting file abstraction is heavily used throughout the
whole system. In addition, Linux supports multiple filesystem types, that is, different ways of organizing data on the physical medium. For example, disks may
be formatted with the Linux-standard ext3 filesystem, the commonly used FAT
filesystem or several others.

Device control
Almost every system operation eventually maps to a physical device. With the
exception of the processor, memory, and a very few other entities, any and all
device control operations are performed by code that is specific to the device
being addressed. That code is called a device driver. The kernel must have
embedded in it a device driver for every peripheral present on a system, from the
hard drive to the keyboard and the tape drive. This aspect of the kernel’s functions is our primary interest in this book.
Networking
Networking must be managed by the operating system, because most network
operations are not specific to a process: incoming packets are asynchronous
events. The packets must be collected, identified, and dispatched before a process takes care of them. The system is in charge of delivering data packets across
program and network interfaces, and it must control the execution of programs
according to their network activity. Additionally, all the routing and address resolution issues are implemented within the kernel.

Loadable Modules
One of the good features of Linux is the ability to extend at runtime the set of
features offered by the kernel. This means that you can add functionality to the
kernel (and remove functionality as well) while the system is up and running.
Each piece of code that can be added to the kernel at runtime is called a module. The
Linux kernel offers support for quite a few different types (or classes) of modules,
including, but not limited to, device drivers. Each module is made up of object code
(not linked into a complete executable) that can be dynamically linked to the running kernel by the insmod program and can be unlinked by the rmmod program.
Figure 1-1 identifies different classes of modules in charge of specific tasks—a module is said to belong to a specific class according to the functionality it offers. The
placement of modules in Figure 1-1 covers the most important classes, but is far from
complete because more and more functionality in Linux is being modularized.

Classes of Devices and Modules
The Linux way of looking at devices distinguishes between three fundamental device
types. Each module usually implements one of these types, and thus is classifiable as a
char module, a block module, or a network module. This division of modules into different types, or classes, is not a rigid one; the programmer can choose to build huge
modules implementing different drivers in a single chunk of code. Good programmers, nonetheless, usually create a different module for each new functionality they
implement, because decomposition is a key element of scalability and extendability.

The three classes are:

<a name="char-devs"></a>
# Character devices

A character (char) device is one that can be accessed as a stream of bytes (like a file); a char driver is in charge of implementing this behavior.
Such a driver usually implements at least the open, close, read, and write system calls.
The text console (/dev/console) and the serial ports (/dev/ttyS0 and friends) are examples of char devices, as they are well represented by the stream abstraction.
Char devices are accessed by means of filesystem nodes, such as /dev/tty1 and /dev/lp0.
<a name="char-devs-l5">The only relevant difference between a char device and a regular file is that you can always move back and forth in the regular file, whereas most char devices are just data channels, which you can only access sequentially.</a> [lidx](lines/c354c6218200ef6edaedcd68a20126cb3ac395c404029d577afb5c34e65025b2)
There exist, nonetheless, char devices that look like data areas, and you can move back and forth in them; for instance, this usually applies to frame grabbers, where the applications can access the whole acquired image using mmap or lseek.

<a name="block-devs"></a>
# Block devices

<a name="block-devs-l1">Like char devices, block devices are accessed by filesystem nodes in the `/dev` directory.</a>
<a name="block-devs-l2">A block device is a device (e.g., a disk) that can host a filesystem.</a>
<a name="block-devs-l3">In most Unix systems, a block device can only handle I/O operations that transfer one or more whole blocks, which are usually 512 bytes (or a larger power of two) bytes in length.</a> [lidx](lines/a7f45f58682bb02a36e149c75ac77991915f6f5b18efa182f26c3c810e17a9d9)
<a name="block-devs-l4">Linux, instead, allows the application to read and write a block device like a char device -- it permits the transfer of any number of bytes at a time.</a>
<a name="block-devs-l5">As a result, block and char devices differ only in the way data is managed internally by the kernel, and thus in the kernel/driver software interface.</a>
<a name="block-devs-l6">Like a char device, each block device is accessed through a filesystem node, and the difference between them is transparent to the user.</a>
<a name="block-devs-l7">Block drivers have a completely different interface to the kernel than char drivers.</a>

<a name="block-devs-q"></a>
## Block devices questions

<a name="block-devs-q1">If a block device can handle operations on blocks which are 512B [line 3](#block-devs-l3) how linux permits the transfer of any bytes at a time [line 4](#block-devs-l4)?</a>

<a name="block-devs-n"></a>
## Block devices notes

<a name="block-devs-n1">I.e. the transparent difference between char device and block device is that the user can `cat /dev/sda1` or `cat /dev/tty2`.

<a name="net-ifs"></a>
# Network interfaces

Any network transaction is made through an interface, that is, a device that is
able to exchange data with other hosts. Usually, an interface is a hardware
device, but it might also be a pure software device, like the loopback interface. A
network interface is in charge of sending and receiving data packets, driven by
the network subsystem of the kernel, without knowing how individual transactions map to the actual packets being transmitted. Many network connections
(especially those using TCP) are stream-oriented, but network devices are, usually, designed around the transmission and receipt of packets. A network driver
knows nothing about individual connections; it only handles packets.
Not being a stream-oriented device, a network interface isn’t easily mapped to a
node in the filesystem, as /dev/tty1 is. The Unix way to provide access to interfaces is still by assigning a unique name to them (such as eth0), but that name
doesn’t have a corresponding entry in the filesystem. Communication between
the kernel and a network device driver is completely different from that used
with char and block drivers. Instead of read and write, the kernel calls functions
related to packet transmission.
There are other ways of classifying driver modules that are orthogonal to the above
device types. In general, some types of drivers work with additional layers of kernel
support functions for a given type of device. For example, one can talk of universal
serial bus (USB) modules, serial modules, SCSI modules, and so on. Every USB
device is driven by a USB module that works with the USB subsystem, but the device
itself shows up in the system as a char device (a USB serial port, say), a block device
(a USB memory card reader), or a network device (a USB Ethernet interface).
Other classes of device drivers have been added to the kernel in recent times, including FireWire drivers and I2O drivers. In the same way that they handled USB and
SCSI drivers, kernel developers collected class-wide features and exported them to
driver implementers to avoid duplicating work and bugs, thus simplifying and
strengthening the process of writing such drivers.

In addition to device drivers, other functionalities, both hardware and software, are
modularized in the kernel. One common example is filesystems. A filesystem type
determines how information is organized on a block device in order to represent a
tree of directories and files. Such an entity is not a device driver, in that there’s no
explicit device associated with the way the information is laid down; the filesystem
type is instead a software driver, because it maps the low-level data structures to
high-level data structures. It is the filesystem that determines how long a filename
can be and what information about each file is stored in a directory entry. The filesystem module must implement the lowest level of the system calls that access directories and files, by mapping filenames and paths (as well as other information, such
as access modes) to data structures stored in data blocks. Such an interface is completely independent of the actual data transfer to and from the disk (or other
medium), which is accomplished by a block device driver.
If you think of how strongly a Unix system depends on the underlying filesystem,
you’ll realize that such a software concept is vital to system operation. The ability to
decode filesystem information stays at the lowest level of the kernel hierarchy and is
of utmost importance; even if you write a block driver for your new CD-ROM, it is
useless if you are not able to run ls or cp on the data it hosts. Linux supports the concept of a filesystem module, whose software interface declares the different operations that can be performed on a filesystem inode, directory, file, and superblock. It’s
quite unusual for a programmer to actually need to write a filesystem module,
because the official kernel already includes code for the most important filesystem
types.

Security Issues
Security is an increasingly important concern in modern times. We will discuss security-related issues as they come up throughout the book. There are a few general concepts, however, that are worth mentioning now.
Any security check in the system is enforced by kernel code. If the kernel has security holes, then the system as a whole has holes. In the official kernel distribution,
only an authorized user can load modules; the system call init_module checks if the
invoking process is authorized to load a module into the kernel. Thus, when running an official kernel, only the superuser,* or an intruder who has succeeded in
becoming privileged, can exploit the power of privileged code.
When possible, driver writers should avoid encoding security policy in their code.
Security is a policy issue that is often best handled at higher levels within the kernel,
under the control of the system administrator. There are always exceptions, however.

* Technically, only somebody with the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability can perform this operation. We discuss
capabilities in Chapter 6.

,ch01.2168 Page 9 Thursday, January 20, 2005 9:21 AM

As a device driver writer, you should be aware of situations in which some types of
device access could adversely affect the system as a whole and should provide adequate controls. For example, device operations that affect global resources (such as
setting an interrupt line), which could damage the hardware (loading firmware, for
example), or that could affect other users (such as setting a default block size on a
tape drive), are usually only available to sufficiently privileged users, and this check
must be made in the driver itself.
Driver writers must also be careful, of course, to avoid introducing security bugs.
The C programming language makes it easy to make several types of errors. Many
current security problems are created, for example, by buffer overrun errors, in which
the programmer forgets to check how much data is written to a buffer, and data ends
up written beyond the end of the buffer, thus overwriting unrelated data. Such errors
can compromise the entire system and must be avoided. Fortunately, avoiding these
errors is usually relatively easy in the device driver context, in which the interface to
the user is narrowly defined and highly controlled.
Some other general security ideas are worth keeping in mind. Any input received
from user processes should be treated with great suspicion; never trust it unless you
can verify it. Be careful with uninitialized memory; any memory obtained from the
kernel should be zeroed or otherwise initialized before being made available to a user
process or device. Otherwise, information leakage (disclosure of data, passwords,
etc.) could result. If your device interprets data sent to it, be sure the user cannot
send anything that could compromise the system. Finally, think about the possible
effect of device operations; if there are specific operations (e.g., reloading the firmware on an adapter board or formatting a disk) that could affect the system, those
operations should almost certainly be restricted to privileged users.
Be careful, also, when receiving software from third parties, especially when the kernel is concerned: because everybody has access to the source code, everybody can
break and recompile things. Although you can usually trust precompiled kernels
found in your distribution, you should avoid running kernels compiled by an
untrusted friend—if you wouldn’t run a precompiled binary as root, then you’d better not run a precompiled kernel. For example, a maliciously modified kernel could
allow anyone to load a module, thus opening an unexpected back door via init_module.
Note that the Linux kernel can be compiled to have no module support whatsoever,
thus closing any module-related security holes. In this case, of course, all needed
drivers must be built directly into the kernel itself. It is also possible, with 2.2 and
later kernels, to disable the loading of kernel modules after system boot via the capability mechanism.

Version Numbering
Before digging into programming, we should comment on the version numbering
scheme used in Linux and which versions are covered by this book.
First of all, note that every software package used in a Linux system has its own
release number, and there are often interdependencies across them: you need a particular version of one package to run a particular version of another package. The
creators of Linux distributions usually handle the messy problem of matching packages, and the user who installs from a prepackaged distribution doesn’t need to deal
with version numbers. Those who replace and upgrade system software, on the other
hand, are on their own in this regard. Fortunately, almost all modern distributions
support the upgrade of single packages by checking interpackage dependencies; the
distribution’s package manager generally does not allow an upgrade until the dependencies are satisfied.
To run the examples we introduce during the discussion, you won’t need particular
versions of any tool beyond what the 2.6 kernel requires; any recent Linux distribution can be used to run our examples. We won’t detail specific requirements,
because the file Documentation/Changes in your kernel sources is the best source of
such information if you experience any problems.
As far as the kernel is concerned, the even-numbered kernel versions (i.e., 2.6.x) are
the stable ones that are intended for general distribution. The odd versions (such as
2.7.x), on the contrary, are development snapshots and are quite ephemeral; the latest of them represents the current status of development, but becomes obsolete in a
few days or so.
This book covers Version 2.6 of the kernel. Our focus has been to show all the features available to device driver writers in 2.6.10, the current version at the time we
are writing. This edition of the book does not cover prior versions of the kernel. For
those of you who are interested, the second edition covered Versions 2.0 through 2.4
in detail. That edition is still available online at http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD2/.
Kernel programmers should be aware that the development process changed with 2.6.
The 2.6 series is now accepting changes that previously would have been considered
too large for a “stable” kernel. Among other things, that means that internal kernel
programming interfaces can change, thus potentially obsoleting parts of this book;
for this reason, the sample code accompanying the text is known to work with 2.6.10,
but some modules don’t compile under earlier versions. Programmers wanting to
keep up with kernel programming changes are encouraged to join the mailing lists
and to make use of the web sites listed in the bibliography. There is also a web page
maintained at http://lwn.net/Articles/2.6-kernel-api/, which contains information
about API changes that have happened since this book was published.

This text doesn’t talk specifically about odd-numbered kernel versions. General users
never have a reason to run development kernels. Developers experimenting with new
features, however, want to be running the latest development release. They usually
keep upgrading to the most recent version to pick up bug fixes and new implementations of features. Note, however, that there’s no guarantee on experimental kernels,*
and nobody helps you if you have problems due to a bug in a noncurrent odd-numbered kernel. Those who run odd-numbered versions of the kernel are usually skilled
enough to dig in the code without the need for a textbook, which is another reason
why we don’t talk about development kernels here.
Another feature of Linux is that it is a platform-independent operating system, not
just “a Unix clone for PC clones” anymore: it currently supports some 20 architectures. This book is platform independent as far as possible, and all the code samples
have been tested on at least the x86 and x86-64 platforms. Because the code has been
tested on both 32-bit and 64-bit processors, it should compile and run on all other
platforms. As you might expect, the code samples that rely on particular hardware
don’t work on all the supported platforms, but this is always stated in the source
code.

License Terms
Linux is licensed under Version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL), a document devised for the GNU project by the Free Software Foundation. The GPL allows
anybody to redistribute, and even sell, a product covered by the GPL, as long as the
recipient has access to the source and is able to exercise the same rights. Additionally, any software product derived from a product covered by the GPL must, if it is
redistributed at all, be released under the GPL.
The main goal of such a license is to allow the growth of knowledge by permitting
everybody to modify programs at will; at the same time, people selling software to
the public can still do their job. Despite this simple objective, there’s a never-ending
discussion about the GPL and its use. If you want to read the license, you can find it
in several places in your system, including the top directory of your kernel source
tree in the COPYING file.
Vendors often ask whether they can distribute kernel modules in binary form only.
The answer to that question has been deliberately left ambiguous. Distribution of
binary modules—as long as they adhere to the published kernel interface—has been
tolerated so far. But the copyrights on the kernel are held by many developers, and
not all of them agree that kernel modules are not derived products. If you or your
employer wish to distribute kernel modules under a nonfree license, you really need

to discuss the situation with your legal counsel. Please note also that the kernel
developers have no qualms against breaking binary modules between kernel releases,
even in the middle of a stable kernel series. If it is at all possible, both you and your
users are better off if you release your module as free software.
If you want your code to go into the mainline kernel, or if your code requires patches
to the kernel, you must use a GPL-compatible license as soon as you release the code.
Although personal use of your changes doesn’t force the GPL on you, if you distribute your code, you must include the source code in the distribution—people acquiring your package must be allowed to rebuild the binary at will.
As far as this book is concerned, most of the code is freely redistributable, either in
source or binary form, and neither we nor O’Reilly retain any right on any derived
works. All the programs are available at ftp://ftp.ora.com/pub/examples/linux/drivers/,

Joining the Kernel Development Community
As you begin writing modules for the Linux kernel, you become part of a larger community of developers. Within that community, you can find not only people engaged
in similar work, but also a group of highly committed engineers working toward
making Linux a better system. These people can be a source of help, ideas, and critical review as well—they will be the first people you will likely turn to when you are
looking for testers for a new driver.
The central gathering point for Linux kernel developers is the linux-kernel mailing
list. All major kernel developers, from Linus Torvalds on down, subscribe to this list.
Please note that the list is not for the faint of heart: traffic as of this writing can run
up to 200 messages per day or more. Nonetheless, following this list is essential for
those who are interested in kernel development; it also can be a top-quality resource
for those in need of kernel development help.

there is a great deal of useful information there. Linux kernel developers are busy
people, and they are much more inclined to help people who have clearly done their
homework first.

Overview of the Book
From here on, we enter the world of kernel programming. Chapter 2 introduces
modularization, explaining the secrets of the art and showing the code for running
modules. Chapter 3 talks about char drivers and shows the complete code for a

memory-based device driver that can be read and written for fun. Using memory as
the hardware base for the device allows anyone to run the sample code without the
need to acquire special hardware.
Debugging techniques are vital tools for the programmer and are introduced in
Chapter 4. Equally important for those who would hack on contemporary kernels is
the management of concurrency and race conditions. Chapter 5 concerns itself with
the problems posed by concurrent access to resources and introduces the Linux
mechanisms for controlling concurrency.
With debugging and concurrency management skills in place, we move to advanced
features of char drivers, such as blocking operations, the use of select, and the important ioctl call; these topics are the subject of Chapter 6.
Before dealing with hardware management, we dissect a few more of the kernel’s
software interfaces: Chapter 7 shows how time is managed in the kernel, and
Chapter 8 explains memory allocation.
Next we focus on hardware. Chapter 9 describes the management of I/O ports and
memory buffers that live on the device; after that comes interrupt handling, in
Chapter 10. Unfortunately, not everyone is able to run the sample code for these
chapters, because some hardware support is actually needed to test the software
interface interrupts. We’ve tried our best to keep required hardware support to a
minimum, but you still need some simple hardware, such as a standard parallel port,
to work with the sample code for these chapters.
Chapter 11 covers the use of data types in the kernel and the writing of portable
code.
The second half of the book is dedicated to more advanced topics. We start by getting deeper into the hardware and, in particular, the functioning of specific peripheral buses. Chapter 12 covers the details of writing drivers for PCI devices, and
Chapter 13 examines the API for working with USB devices.
With an understanding of peripheral buses in place, we can take a detailed look at the
Linux device model, which is the abstraction layer used by the kernel to describe the
hardware and software resources it is managing. Chapter 14 is a bottom-up look at
the device model infrastructure, starting with the kobject type and working up from
there. It covers the integration of the device model with real hardware; it then uses
that knowledge to cover topics like hot-pluggable devices and power management.
In Chapter 15, we take a diversion into Linux memory management. This chapter
shows how to map kernel memory into user space (the mmap system call), map user
memory into kernel space (with get_user_pages), and how to map either kind of
memory into device space (to perform direct memory access [DMA] operations).

Our understanding of memory will be useful for the following two chapters, which
cover the other major driver classes. Chapter 16 introduces block drivers and shows
how they are different from the char drivers we have worked with so far. Then
Chapter 17 gets into the writing of network drivers. We finish up with a discussion
of serial drivers (Chapter 18) and a bibliography.

What emphasizes the word "flexible" regarding a driver?
