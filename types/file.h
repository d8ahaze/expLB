/**
 * struct file -- ...
 * @fmode:	The file mode identifies the file as either readable or writable (or both), by means of the bits FMODE_READ and FMODE_WRITE.
 *		You might want to check this field for read/write permission in your open or ioctl function, but you donâ€™t need to check permissions for read and write, because the kernel checks before invoking your method.
 *		An attempt to read or write when the file has not been opened for that type of access is rejected without the driver even knowing about it.
 * @f_op:	The operations associated with the file.
 *		The kernel assigns the pointer as part of its implementation of `open` and then reads it when it needs to ?(dispatch) any operations.
 *		The value in `filp->f_op` is never saved by the kernel for later reference; this means that you can change the file operations associated with your file, and the new methods will be effective after you return to the caller.
 *		For example, the code for `open` associated with major number 1 (/dev/null, /dev/zero, and so on) substitutes the operations in `filp->f_op` depending on the minor number being opened.
 *		This practice allows the implementation of several behaviors under the same major number without introducing overhead at each system call.
 *		The ability to replace the file operations is the kernel equivalent of "method overriding" in object-oriented programming.
